html-indent
-----------

`html-indent` is a html file indenter and checker. This is a pre-release (see todo.org)

### Alternatives

* [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) environment.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. Unfortunately, the indentation doesn't work
  with newlines inside tags.
